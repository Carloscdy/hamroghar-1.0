      "When selling your house in Nepal, you’ll need ownership documents, land registration certificate, tax clearance, and other legal paperwork.",
    details: `Selling a house in Nepal involves several legal and administrative steps. 
    The most important documents include the Land Ownership Certificate (Lalpurja), updated land revenue tax clearance, and proof of citizenship. 
    You’ll also need to submit an application at the Land Revenue Office for the official transfer of property. 
    It is also recommended to have your property evaluated to determine its fair market value. 
    If you’re selling through a real estate agent, make sure they are registered and trustworthy. 
    Documentation ensures the sale is legally binding and prevents disputes later. 
    A lawyer can help verify papers and confirm that the buyer is financially capable of finalizing the transaction. 
    This extra step ensures peace of mind and avoids fraud.`,

    content:
      "Negotiating property deals requires market research, patience, and knowing the seller’s motivations.",
    details: `Negotiating in real estate is both an art and a science. 
    As a buyer in Nepal, the first step is to research property values in the local market so you know a fair price before making an offer. 
    Understanding the seller’s urgency can give you an advantage. 
    If the seller is relocating or needs quick cash, you may be able to negotiate a lower price. 
    On the other hand, if the property is in high demand, you should focus on offering flexible payment terms rather than just a reduced price. 
    Always put your terms in writing, and be ready to walk away if the deal doesn’t meet your expectations. 
    A strong negotiation requires patience, clarity, and confidence.`,

      "Finding reliable tenants is crucial for landlords. Screening, background checks, and clear agreements help avoid disputes.",
    details: `Being a landlord in Nepal can be rewarding, but it also comes with risks if you don’t choose tenants wisely. 
    Start by conducting a background check, asking for references, and verifying employment or business stability. 
    A written rental agreement is essential. Include terms like rent amount, due dates, late fees, and maintenance responsibilities. 
    A clear contract reduces misunderstandings and protects both parties. 
    Regular communication with your tenants also builds trust. 
    Promptly addressing maintenance requests and keeping the property in good condition helps you attract and retain quality tenants.`,

    Landscaping and gardening also create a lasting first impression.
